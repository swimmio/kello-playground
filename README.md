### Kello Imagens Business Operations Management System (in-house developed)

## Task

UpWork Customer: detailed software auditing to understand what the package is, what it does, its features and, as high priority, the Data model and Data flow. 
The first package was retrieved from a Jump Drive and shared via OneDrive in .RAR format (fontes_kello.rar), containing approx. 3,000 files (source files, sub-routine - method, functions - source files, compiled .OBJ files, compiled .GS graphic user interface files, compiler output report files, configuration files).

## High Level Work Plan

  - Discovery
  - Package file inventory
  - File types (extensions) present in the package
  - Set up GitHub repo
  - Set up Visual Studio IDE with Microfocus COBOL extensions
  - Complete package immersion
  - Formulate initial hypothesis and take-away's
  - Look for further content (code, existing build, data, stand alone workstation dump)

### Summary of Tech Stack: 
This business system was written using COBOL-85 syntax and most recently compiled using Micro Focus Net Express V3.1 revision 255 Compiler (Copyright (C) 1984-2002 Micro Focus International Ltd.). There is content generated with Micro Focus COBOL 2002 .NET extensions (the GUI and user interaction). The system was used in a file-sharing LAN environment - apparently using the VirtuOS network operating system - with executables and data repositories located in a standard configured F:\PROGRAMA\KELLO\ directory, a shared storage located in theserver, for every authenticated LAN user.

### Functionality Highlights: 
The system generates automatic printed reports and has Bank specific EDI transactions to generate Bank specific file formats for Accounts Receivable process (CEF Bank), to generate standard SBP payment slips (Banks HSBC and Ita√∫). 
The application is an in-house developed CRM-like system, with detailed sales historic, prediction, seller, cash flow components, among others.

## Folder and File Structure

\app foldrt: source, layout, UI scripts, and compiled files from last known build compiled version, organized by type.
There is no structure or organization (except organization by extensions) since no script or instructions to generate a running version was found.

\data folder: configuration files and random data files found throughout the available sources (like the hard drive and the pen drive). Files under this folder and subfolders are addresses client lists, and a series of messages containing compiler output dialogs, apparently automatically generated by compiler, during compilation pricess. The process was being executed in "F:\Desenvol2\kello\" folder, likely a mapped network drive.

\docs folder contains screenshots from the user's notebook, and company's logos used in reports and repository.

\app_aux folder contains the application "DoroPDFWriter", apparently the application used by Kello's main management system to generate PDF files.
Also, known executable build of "EnotaNFCeCNG_2.0", developed using Telerik (https://www.telerik.com/) tools to add UI controls to the application. The function of this graphic component of the application is related to transmission and revison of tax numbers of a business, by generating a digital certificate to protect the information exchange.
Among the XML files, one can find the directpry structure to create to replicate the las known running instalation. Below, two screenshots of the main interface application window and the window that pops up when a certificate is requested.
